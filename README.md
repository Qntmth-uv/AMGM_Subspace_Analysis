# AMGM Subspace Analysis

Given a quadratic optimization problem we can use several quadratic programing to solve this kind of problems. In the present we make a set of experiments based on the given of Harry Ovideo. Instead of only using the subespace generated by the tree vectors, we generalize this creating a set of different algoritms using different subspaces. For example using only one or two vectors. 


We found a very particular situation were the third factor is most of the time near zero. So the algorithm that only uses two of those vector have a very similar behavior. In this sense, we try to see if this two algorithms are stadisticalty speaking equivalent or even trying to proof that the third vector is in essency cero.
